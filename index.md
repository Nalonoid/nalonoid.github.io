My name’s **Nolan** Mestres. I’m a third year **PhD student** within [Maverick research team] (INRIA, Jean Kuntzmann Laboratory), under the supervision of [Joëlle Thollot] and [Romain Vergne]. I focus my work on **expressive rendering** and image stylization, taking inspiration from the case study of **panorama maps**.
I graduated in 2018 with a Master's degree in Computer Graphics & Image Analysis from Paul Sabatier University (Toulouse, France). I did my graduation internship under the supervision of [Imari Sato], at the National Institute of Informatics (Tokyo, Japan), working on spectral rendering and fluorescence. For more information about my educational background you can browse my (outdated) [resume].
