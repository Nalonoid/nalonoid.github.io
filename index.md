My name’s **Nolan** Mestres. I am a post-doc within the [Maverick research team] (Jean Kuntzmann Laboratory, Inria Grenoble). My work focuses on **expressive rendering**, taking inspiration from the case study of the haind-painted **panorama maps of Pierre Novat**.
This is a follow-up work of the PhD thesis I did under the supervision of [Joëlle Thollot] and [Romain Vergne], at Université Grenoble Alpes. Before that, during my Master's, I did my graduation internship under the supervision of [Imari Sato], at the National Institute of Informatics (Tokyo, Japan), working on spectral rendering and fluorescence. For more information about my educational background you can browse my [resume].

## Open positions 2022-2023

[Internships in the context of stylized panorama maps]

Supervised by Joëlle Thollot, Romain Vergne, Fabrice Neyret, Kenneth Vanhoey, and myself, depending on the chosen topic.

- generalization of GIS data (filtering, smoothing, LoD,...)
- rendering of cartographic elements (trees, rock, roads, buildings)
- semi-automatic terrain deformation (human-computer interaction, optimization problem)
- open to proposals within this framework!

Location: [Maverick research team], Inria Grenoble, France
