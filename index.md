My name’s **Nolan** Mestres. I’m a third year **PhD student** within [Maverick research team] (Jean Kuntzmann Laboratory, Inria Grenoble), under the supervision of [Joëlle Thollot] and [Romain Vergne]. I focus my work on **expressive rendering** and image stylization, taking inspiration from the case study of **panorama maps**.
I graduated in 2018 with a Master's degree in Computer Graphics & Image Analysis from Paul Sabatier University (Toulouse, France). I did my graduation internship under the supervision of [Imari Sato], at the National Institute of Informatics (Tokyo, Japan), working on spectral rendering and fluorescence. For more information about my educational background you can browse my (outdated) [resume].  

## Open positions 2022-2023

[Internships in the context of stylized panorama maps]

Supervised by Joëlle Thollot, Romain Vergne, Fabrice Neyret, Kenneth Vanhoey, and myself, depending on the chosen topic.

- generalization of GIS data (filtering, smoothing, LoD,...)
- rendering of cartographic elements (trees, rock, roads, buildings)
- semi-automatic terrain deformation (human-computer interaction, optimization problem)
- open to proposals within this framework!

Location: [Maverick research team], Inria Grenoble, France
