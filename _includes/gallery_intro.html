<p>I am the author of all these photographies.
These are mostly travel pictures but I like what they remind me of.
Taking into account that you are (probably) not gifted with mind vision, you might find them a bit boring to browse, but eh, you are warned.</p>
<p>I used both digital and analogic cameras to capture them.
Right now, I have two analogic cameras: a small 1978 <strong>Minolta Hi-Matic SD</strong> and a 1982 <strong>Canon AL-1</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy the view!<strong></p>
