<p>My name’s <strong>Nolan</strong> Mestres. I’m a first year <strong>PhD student</strong> in the <a href="https://maverick.inria.fr/">MAVERICK</a> research team (INRIA, Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann), under the supervision of <a href="https://maverick.inria.fr/~Joelle.Thollot/">Joelle Thollot</a> &amp; <a href="https://maverick.inria.fr/~Romain.Vergne/blog/">Romain Vergne</a>. My main research interests are <strong>expressive rendering, shape depiction and image synthesis stylization</strong>.</p>

<p>The subject of my PhD is linked with <strong>mountain panorama maps</strong>. It is a broad topic that covers many fields from history, geography, to visual perception and rendering. I am focused on the style of the <a href="http://atelier.novat.free.fr/atelier_pierre_novat/liste_des_panoramas.html">Atelier Pierre Novat</a>, that produces hand-made paintings with a high aesthetic quality but still conveying information in a very efficient way. My main goal is to <strong>understand the style of the artist</strong>, i.e. translate his sensitivity and intuitions into concepts and algorithms. I also aim at providing automated ways to render such panoramas and tools to allow artists to finely control their production. One of the key idea is to <strong>understand what degrees of freedom we have with respect to reality, without altering global coherence and plausibility of the panorama</strong>.</p>

<p>I am also interested in spectral rendering and fluorescence. That’s why I did my master’s thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://research.nii.ac.jp/~imarik/">Imari Sato</a>, at the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo. There, I was working on the ‘Rendering of fluorescent materials using spectral path tracing’.</p>

<p>I will use this website to present the different projects I am working on, as well as personal stuff. For more information about my educational background you can browse my (outdated) <a href="./res/nolan_mestres-resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
