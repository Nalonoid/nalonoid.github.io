This project was proposed and supervised by [David Vanderhaeghe](http://www.dlyr.fr/stuff/), associate professor at the University of Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier and part of the [STORM](https://www.irit.fr/STORM/site/) team at the [Toulouse Institute of Computer Science Research](https://www.irit.fr/?lang=en) (IRIT).

The purpose of this project was to implement parts of the scientific publication, [AniPaint: interactive painterly animation from video](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~donovan/anipaint/) by Peter O'Donovan and Aaron Hertzmann.

Our final system renders painterly images from pictures.
