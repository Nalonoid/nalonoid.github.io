I undertook this work at the [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) (NII) in Tokyo, Japan, under the supervision of [Imari Sato](http://research.nii.ac.jp/~imarik/).
It was part of my year-end internship, during my second year of Master's degree.

Throughout the internship I developped a rendering engine that accounts for the fluorescence of materials.
It is based on Monte Carlo methods and uses a spectral path tracing algorithm.

The [source code](https://github.com/Nalonoid/niixtracer) of the project is available on GitHub and of course, any contribution is welcomed.
